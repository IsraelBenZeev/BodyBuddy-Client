# Overview

- For styling, always prioritize Tailwind CSS classes.
- Primary App Colors: Use 'lime-500' for primary accents and 'background-850' for backgrounds (both are pre-configured in tailwind.config.js).
- Inline/Standard Styles: If Tailwind is not applicable, use the centralized color palette from the 'colors' variable.
- Color Reference: Import the color constants from the following path:
  C:\Users\i0548\Documents\Full stack lessons\BodyBuddy\BodyBuddy-client\colors.ts
- When using the 'colors.ts' file, ensure you use the naming convention defined within the 'colors' object to maintain consistency with the Tailwind config.
